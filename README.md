🌾 Market Match Platform

 Problem
Small-scale farmers struggle to access timely, accurate market information and buyers for their produce. This leads to low profits, waste, and missed opportunities.

 Solution
**Market Match** is a mobile-first platform (with SMS/USSD support) that:
- Sends real-time market price alerts to farmers.
- Matches farmers with nearby buyers or markets.
- Supports low-end phones using SMS/USSD.
